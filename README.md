# Hello, I'm Riley.
I like to code, with a focus on frontend web development. So far, these are the things I have experience in (i.e. used extensively in multiple projects):

| Frontend Web Development             | Backend Web Development | Misc.        | Languages  |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|------------|
| React (Create React App and Next.js) | Node.js                 | React Native | HTML/CSS   |
| Tailwind CSS                         | Express                 | Electron     | Javascript |
| Chakra UI                            | Socket.io               | Discord.js   | Typescript |
| jQuery                               | Firebase                |              | Java       |
| Handlebars.js                        | Postgres                |              | Python     |
| Matter.js                            | Redis                   |              | PostgreSQL |


Past projects (most of which are not public) include desktop apps, mobile apps, web apps, web servers, web crawlers, web UI designs, Chrome extensions, Discord bots, 2D games, physics games, and algorithm implementations.
